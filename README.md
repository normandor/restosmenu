# RestosMenu
This open source Symfony 5 project was made as a free web app for restaurants so that they can offer a "QR to menu" option.
It consists of an admin for managers, where a QR code is generated, that can be printed, shown to the clients, and that will redirect to a public URL of the restaurant's menu.
